## CST8917 Assignment 1: Durable Workflow for Image Metadata Processing


### Objective

Build a serverless image metadata processing pipeline using Azure Durable Functions in Python. This assignment challenges you to use blob triggers, activity functions, and output bindings, and to deploy a complete solution to Azure. You'll simulate a real-world event-driven system.

### Scenario

A fictional content moderation team wants to analyze the metadata of user-uploaded images. Your Durable Functions app should:

Automatically trigger when a new image is uploaded to blob storage.
Extract metadata (e.g., file size, format, dimensions).
Store the metadata in an Azure SQL Database.
Workflow Requirements

### Step 1: Blob Trigger (Client Function)

Create a blob-triggered function that starts the orchestration.
The blob container (e.g., images-input) should accept .jpg, .png, or .gif images.

### Step 2: Orchestrator Function

The orchestrator should:
Call an activity function to extract metadata from the image.
Call a second activity function to store that metadata in Azure SQL DB via output binding.

### Step 3: Activity Function – Extract Metadata

Extract the following from each image:
File name
File size in KB
Width and height (in pixels)
Image format (e.g., JPEG, PNG)
Step 4: Activity Function – Store Metadata

Use Azure SQL output binding to store the image metadata.
